At the end of the course, we want students to look back at their statistics course and realize that they learned practical concepts that will serve them well for the rest of their lives. We also want students to come to appreciate that in practice, assumptions are not perfectly satisfied, models are not exactly correct, distributions are not exactly normally distributed, and different factors should be considered in conducting a statistical analysis. The title of our book reflects the experience of data analysts, who soon realize that statistics is an art as well as a science"--},

  abstract = {We explore the long-term political consequences of the Third Reich and show that current political intolerance, xenophobia, and voting for radical right-wing parties are associated with proximity to former Nazi concentration camps in Germany. This relationship is not explained by contemporary attitudes, the location of the camps, geographic sorting, the economic impact of the camps, or their current use. We argue that cognitive dissonance led those more directly exposed to Nazi institutions to conform with the belief system of the regime. These attitudes were then transmitted across generations. The evidence provided here contributes both to our understanding of the legacies of historical institutions and the sources of political intolerance.},

  abstract = {A wealth of recent research in comparative politics examines how spatial variation in historical conditions shapes modern political outcomes. In an article in the               American Political Science Review               , Homola, Pereira, and Tavits argue that Germans who live nearer to former Nazi concentration camps are more likely to display out-group intolerance. Clarifying the conceptual foundations of posttreatment bias and reviewing the historical record on postwar state creation in Germany, we argue that state-level differences confound the relationship between distance to camps and out-group intolerance. Using publicly available European Values Survey data and electoral results from 2017, we find no consistent evidence that distance to camps is related to contemporary values. Our findings have implications for literatures on historical persistence, causal inference with spatial data, Holocaust studies, and outgroup tolerance.},
